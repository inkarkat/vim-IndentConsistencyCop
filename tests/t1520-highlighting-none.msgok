Found inconsistent indentation in this buffer; generated from these conflicting settings: 
- 4 characters soft tabstop (8 of 77 lines)
- bad mix of spaces and tabs (2 of 77 lines)
Some minor / inconclusive potential settings have been omitted. 
The buffer setting is tabstop. 
[I]gnore, (J)ust change buffer settings...: 
Be careful when modifying the inconsistent indents!
