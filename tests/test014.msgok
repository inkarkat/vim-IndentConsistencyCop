The buffer's indent settings are inconsistent with the used indent '2 characters soft tabstop'; these settings must be changed: 
- tabstop from 4 to 8
- softtabstop from 0 to 2
- shiftwidth from 4 to 2
How do you want to deal with the inconsistency?
(I)gnore, [C]hange, Wrong, use (b)uffer settings (tabstop), (W)rong, choose correct setting...: 
The buffer settings have been changed: tabstop=8 softtabstop=2 shiftwidth=2 noexpandtab
