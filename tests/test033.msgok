The buffer's indent settings are inconsistent with the used indent '4 spaces'; these settings must be changed: 
- softtabstop from 0 to 4
- shiftwidth from 8 to 4
- noexpandtab to expandtab
How do you want to deal with the inconsistency?
(I)gnore, [C]hange, Wrong, use (b)uffer settings (tabstop), (W)rong, choose correct setting...: 
The buffer settings have been changed: tabstop=8 softtabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 expandtab
