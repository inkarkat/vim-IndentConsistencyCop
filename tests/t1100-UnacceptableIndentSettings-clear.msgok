The buffer's indent settings are inconsistent with the used indent '1 spaces'; these settings must be changed: 
- softtabstop from 2 to 1
- shiftwidth from 2 to 1
How do you want to deal with the inconsistency?

The buffer settings remain inconsistent: tabstop=8 softtabstop=2 shiftwidth=2 expandtab
