The buffer's indent settings are inconsistent with the used indent '4 characters soft tabstop'; these settings must be changed: 
- tabstop from 4 to 8
- softtabstop from 0 to 4
How do you want to deal with the inconsistency?
(I)gnore, [C]hange, Wrong, use (b)uffer settings (tabstop), (W)rong, use correct tab4: 
Marked 8 incorrect lines. The buffer settings have been changed: tabstop=4 softtabstop=0 shiftwidth=4 noexpandtab
