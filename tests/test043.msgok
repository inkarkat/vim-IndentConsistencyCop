The buffer's indent settings are potentially inconsistent with the used indent '4 characters soft tabstop'; these settings must be changed: 
- shiftwidth from 2 to 4
Warning: The maximum indent of 8 is too small for a solid assessment. 
How do you want to deal with the potential inconsistency?
[I]gnore, (C)hange, (W)rong, choose correct setting...: 
The buffer settings have been changed: tabstop=8 softtabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 noexpandtab
