The buffer's indent settings are potentially inconsistent with the used indent '2 characters soft tabstop'; these settings must be changed: 
- softtabstop from 4 to 2
- shiftwidth from 4 to 2
Warning: The maximum indent of 8 is too small for a solid assessment. 
How do you want to deal with the potential inconsistency?
