The buffer's indent settings are inconsistent with the used indent '2 characters soft tabstop'; these settings must be changed: 
- softtabstop from 4 to 2
- shiftwidth from 4 to 2
How do you want to deal with the inconsistency?
[I]gnore, (C)hange, (W)rong, choose correct setting...: 
The buffer settings have been changed: tabstop=8 softtabstop=2 shiftwidth=2 noexpandtab
